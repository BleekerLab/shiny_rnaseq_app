# About

## The tomato gene explorer
RNA-seq datasets were aligned against the tomato genome (SL2.50 or SL4.0 assembly) together with the annotation ITAG2.4 or ITAG4.0 using the [snakemake-rnaseq pipeline release v0.3.8](https://github.com/BleekerLab/snakemake_rnaseq/releases/tag/v0.3.8).

The tomato genome references can be found on Sol Genomics:
- [Genome assembly](https://solgenomics.net/ftp/tomato_genome/Heinz1706/assembly/build_2.50/).   
- [Genome annotation](https://solgenomics.net/ftp/tomato_genome/Heinz1706/annotation/ITAG2.4_release/).  

Your favorite gene might not exist in ITAG2.5 or ITAG4.0 annotations. 
Please check online in the [Sol Genomics genome browser](https://solgenomics.net/jbrowse_solgenomics/?data=data%2Fjson%2FSL2.50&loc=SL2.50ch00%3A8723336..13084500&tracks=DNA%2Cgene_models&highlight=) that it exists.



## Datasets 
These RNA-seq datasets are archived at Zenodo and, for some of them, at the EBI European Nucleotide Archive with accession numbers. 

1. Tomato active and lazy type 6 isolated glands.  
2. Tomato tissues: bald stems, leaf and leaf primordia. [Zenodo 2020 data record](10.5281/zenodo.3954272).  
3. Cultivated and wild tomato stem trichomes (2016): ENA accession **PRJEB44371**.
4. MYC1-related genotypes (2020): ENA accession **PRJEB49287**.
